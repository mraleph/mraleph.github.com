At some point late in 2023 I have realized that I have stopped reading books
and I have decided to make an effort and stop killing my brain cells scrolling
through social media. Instead, I started dedicating my evening time to reading
books. I am still not 100% consistent with it - but in 2024 I read more books
than in 2019,2020,2021,2022 and 2023 years all combined. Today I am looking
back at the books I have read and what I learned from them.

## Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed

**&mdash; by Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101438.Skunk_Works)〉

The dictionary defines *skunkworks* as *an experimental laboratory or
department of a company or institution, typically smaller than and
independent of its main research division*. I have heard this term before
and was familiar with its meaning - but what I did not know was that this
term originates at Lockheed Martin. [Skunk Works][] was a pseudonym for Lockheed
Martin's _Advanced Development Programs_ division.

Even if you like me don't care much about aircraft design,
you probably still heard at least something about [F-117][], [U-2][] and
[Blackbird (SR-71)][]. All of these aircrafts were developed at Lockheed Martin
by Skunk Works.

It was interesting to read a personal recounting of how these and few other
projects went written from the perspective of [Ben Rich][], the lead developer
behind F-117. Not being an aeronautics buff I read this book mostly as an
expose on life of a scrappy high expertise R&D team. It was rather interesting
to note parallels between Skunk Works and a tightly knit senior software
engineering team. <sidenote>I did find it slightly suspicious that the book
contains at least one clearly false statement. In <em>Blowing up Burbank</em>
Ben Rich writes <em>... Soviets launched their Sputnik 1 into orbit. The rocket
engine that had carried it into space was hydrogen-fueled. The engine builder
was Pyotr Kapitsa, who had been released from the gulag not to build an
airplane but to launch Sputnik.</em>. Sputnik 1 was carried into an orbit by
a kerosine fueled rocket and Kapitsa was never in a gulag or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharashka" target="_blank">sharashka</a>.</sidenote>

Here is one of my favorite quotes from the book:

> Our work areas were very skunky, ladders all over the place, lots of wiring to
> trip over, an oil slick or two. We had worked fast and loose from day one—with
> seldom an accident or a screwup. That was part of our charm, I thought. We were
> great innovators, rule benders, chance takers, and when appropriate, corner
> cutters. We did things like fuel airplanes inside an assembly area — a strictly
> forbidden act that risked fires or worse—to solve the problem of not having to
> move a very secret airplane into daylight to see if its fuel system leaked. Our
> people knew what they were doing, worked skillfully under intense pressure,
> and skirted hazards mostly by sheer expertise and experience. But as we
> grew, the skill level decreased and sloppiness suddenly became a serious
> problem.

The type of engineering you are doing as a high performing senior team is not
going to work for you when you need to bring juniors on board and scale
yourself.

I was also surprised to learn that the math behind F-117 was derived from a
paper by Soviet scientist [Pyotr Ufimtsev][]:

> I wish I could claim to have had a sudden two a.m. revelation that made me
> bolt upright in bed and shout “Eureka!” But most of my dreams involved
> being chased through a maze of blind alleys by a horde of hostile accountants
> wielding axes and pitchforks.
>
> The truth is that an exceptional thirty-six-year-old Skunk Works mathematician
> and radar specialist named Denys Overholser decided to drop by my office one
> April afternoon and presented me with the Rosetta Stone breakthrough for
> stealth technology.

> ...
>
> Denys had discovered this nugget deep inside a long, dense technical paper on
> radar written by one of Russia’s leading experts and published in Moscow nine
> years earlier. That paper was a sleeper in more ways than one: called
> “Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction,” it had only
> recently been translated by the Air Force Foreign Technology Division from
> the original Russian language. The author was Pyotr Ufimtsev, chief
> scientist at the Moscow Institute of Radio Engineering. As Denys admitted,

>
> “Ufimtsev has shown us how to create computer software to accurately

> and get a precise total of the radar cross section.”

Talk about globalization of knowledge! You might have all the scientific insight
you need but you can fail capitalize on it.

## Understanding Michael Porter: The Essential Guide to Competition and Strategy

**&mdash; by Joan Magretta** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13263934-understanding-michael-porter)〉

My wife hooked me up on this book by reading passages aloud for me to hear. I
found those really insightful - even though I (unlike her) had no idea who this
[Michael Porter][] is.

> If rivals all pursue the “one best way” to compete, they will find themselves
> on a collision course. Everyone in the industry will listen to the same
> advice and follow the same prescription. Companies will benchmark each
> other’s  practices  and  products (see  “One-Upmanship  Is  Not  Strategy”).
> Competing to be the best leads inevitably to a destructive, zero-sum
> competition that no one can win. As offerings converge, gain for one becomes
> loss for the other. This is the very essence of “zero sum.” I win only
> if you lose.

> When  choice  is  limited,  value  is  often  destroyed.  As  a  customer,
> you are either paying too much for extras you don’t want, or you are forced
> to make do with what’s offered, even if it’s not really what you need.
>
> In  practice,  then,  head-to-head  competition  is  rarely  “perfect”  for
> either customers or the companies that serve them. Yet Porter notes with
> some alarm that it is precisely this kind of zero-sum competition that has
> come increasingly to dominate management thinking.

> For Porter, strategic competition means choosing a path different from that of
> others.  Instead  of  competing  to  be  the  best,  companies  can — and
> should — compete to be *unique*. This concept is all about value.
> It’s about uniqueness in the value you create and how you create it.
>
> ...
>
> Competing to be the best feeds on imitation. Competing to be unique thrives
> on innovation.

After a couple of these I just could not wait for her to finish rereading
this book to jump into it myself... and it did not disappoint.

My day-to-day job is far removed from a _business strategy_ side of things, but
I found it interesting to try and translate Porter's ideas into the realm where
programming languages (or more broadly: any programming technologies) compete
for the market share. This book also gave me a better tools to understand
why certain _strategies_ are not strategies at all.

> Strategy, then, defines a way of competing, reflected in a set of activities
> that delivers  unique  value  in  a  particular  set  of  uses  or  for  a
> particular  set  of customers, or both.
>
> ...
>
> While  not  every  single  activity  need  be  unique,  robust  strategies
> always involve a significant degree of tailoring. To establish a competitive
> advantage, a company must deliver its distinctive value through a distinctive
> value chain. It must  perform  different  activities  than  rivals  or
> perform  similar  activities  in different ways.

## The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail

**&mdash; by Clayton M. Christensen** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2615.The_Innovator_s_Dilemma)〉

I was drawn to this book by the same interest that made me read "Understanding
Michael Porter": I wanted to see if the classical business writing can reveal
anything interesting about the realm of programming languages. To a software
engineer or a PLT researcher it might seem that the key to the adoption of a
programming language lies in devising the best type system or implementing
the fastest virtual machine or the best tooling. But the practice seems
to show again and again that this is not the case. Some other factors seems to
be at play here - and understanding these factors requires understanding
_people_ and _business relationships_ rather than lambda calculus and
low-level programming.

One of the key observations of this book is that a well run company can fail
by catering too much to its existing customer base and as result failing to
anticipate and react in time to a _disruptive innovation_ which creates a larger
and more lucrative market. Christensen argues that values which make large
companies successful and profitable are often the very same values which
prevent these companies from capitalizing on disruptive innovations. When
everything at the company is tuned to squeeze the last bit of profit from
an existing market - such company can't quickly enter a new market which
opens through the disruptive innovation.

> In the instances studied in this book, established firms confronted with
> disruptive technology typically viewed their primary development challenge
> as a **technological** one: to improve the disruptive technology enough that
> it suits known markets. In contrast, the firms that were most successful in
> commercializing a disruptive technology were those framing their primary
> development challenge as a **marketing** one: to build or find a market where
> product competition occurred along dimensions that favored the disruptive
> attributes of the product.
>
> It is critical that managers confronting disruptive technology observe this
> principle. If history is any guide, companies that keep disruptive
> technologies bottled up in their labs, working to improve them until they
> suit mainstream markets, will not be nearly as successful as firms that find
> markets that embrace the attributes of disruptive technologies as they
> initially stand. These latter firms, by creating a commercial base and then
> moving upmarket, will ultimately address the mainstream market much more
> effectively than will firms that have framed disruptive technology as a
> laboratory, rather than a marketing, challenge.

A lot of the book is dedicated to history of HDDs, but it also tells a number
of interesting stories from other technological sectors. I was personally
fascinated by these two. One was the story of Honda breaking into
North American motorcycle market.

> Honda’s success in attacking and dominating the North American and European
> motorcycle markets has been cited as a superb example of clear strategic
> thinking coupled with aggressive and coherent execution. According to these
> accounts, Honda employed a deliberate manufacturing strategy based on
> an experience curve in which it cut prices, built volume, aggressively
> reduced costs, cut prices some more, reduced costs further, and built an
> unassailable volume-based low-cost manufacturing position in the motorcycle
> market. Honda then used that base to move upmarket and ultimately blew all
> established motorcycle manufacturers out of the market except for
> Harley-Davidson and BMW, which barely survived. Honda combined this
> manufacturing triumph with a clever product design, catchy advertising,
> and a convenient, broad-based distributor/retailer network tailored to the
> informal cyclists who constituted Honda’s core customer base. Told in this
> manner, Honda’s history is a tale of strategic brilliance and operational
> excellence that all managers dream will be told about them someday. The
> reality of Honda’s achievement, as recounted by the Honda employees who were
> managing the business at the time, however, is quite different.
>
> During Japan’s years of post-war reconstruction and poverty, Honda had emerged
> as a supplier of small, rugged motorized bicycles that were used by
> distributors and retailers in congested urban areas to make small deliveries
> to local customers. Honda developed considerable expertise in designing small,
> efficient engines for these bikes. Its Japanese market sales grew from an
> initial annual volume of 1,200 units in 1949 to 285,000 units in 1959.
>
> Honda’s executives were eager to exploit the company’s low labor costs to
> export motorbikes to North America, but there was no equivalent market there
> for its popular Japanese “Supercub” delivery bike. Honda’s research showed
> that Americans used motorcyles primarily for over-the-road distance driving in
> which size, power, and speed were the most highly valued product attributes.
> Accordingly, Honda engineers designed a fast, powerful motorcycle specifically
> for the American market, and in 1959 Honda dispatched three employees to Los
> Angeles to begin marketing efforts. To save living expenses, the three shared
> an apartment, and each brought with him a Supercub bike to provide cheap
> transportation around the city.
>
> The venture was a frustrating experience from the beginning. Honda’s products
> offered no advantage to prospective customers other than cost, and most
> motorcycle dealers refused to accept the unproven product line. When the team
> finally succeeded in finding some dealers and selling a few hundred units, the
> results were disastrous. Honda’s understanding of engine design turned out not
> to be transferable to highway applications, in which bikes were driven at high
> speeds for extended periods: The engines sprung oil leaks and the clutches
> wore out. Honda’s expenses in air-freighting the warrantied replacement
> motorcycles between Japan and Los Angeles nearly sunk the company.
>
> Meanwhile, one Saturday, Kihachiro Kawashima, the Honda executive in charge of
> the North American venture, decided to vent his frustrations by taking his
> Supercub into the hills east of Los Angeles. It helped: He felt better after
> zipping around in the dirt. A few weeks later he sought relief dirt-biking

> Supercubs. Their neighbors and others who saw them zipping around the hills
> began inquiring where they could buy those cute little bikes, and the trio
> obliged by special-ordering Supercub models for them from Japan. This private
> use of what became known as off-road dirt bikes continued for a couple of
> years. At one point a Sears buyer tried to order Supercubs for the company’s
> outdoor power equipment departments, but Honda ignored the opportunity,
> preferring to focus on selling large, powerful, over-the-road cycles, a
> strategy that continued to be unsuccessful.
>
> Finally, as more and more people clamored for their own little Honda Supercubs

> management in Japan that while the company’s large bike strategy was doomed to
> failure, another quite different opportunity to create a totally new market
> segment merited pursuit.
>
> Once the small-bike strategy was formally adopted, the team found that

> class of product. Ultimately, Honda persuaded a few sporting goods dealers to
> take on its line of motorbikes, and as they began to promote the bikes
> successfully, Honda’s innovative distribution strategy was born.

> Honda had no money for a sophisticated advertising campaign. But a UCLA

> advertising course. Encouraged by his teacher, he sold the idea to an
> advertising agency, which then convinced Honda to use it in what became an
> award-winning advertising campaign. These serendipitous events were, of
> course, followed by truly world-class design engineering and manufacturing
> execution, which enabled Honda to repeatedly lower its prices as it improved
> its product quality and increased its production volumes.
>
> Honda’s 50cc motorbike was a disruptive technology in the North American

The second one is the story of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly:

> Another case of performance oversupply and disruptive technology precipitating a
> change in the basis of competition—and threatening a change in industry
> leadership—is found in the worldwide insulin business. In 1922, four researchers
> in Toronto first successfully extracted insulin from the pancreases of animals
> and injected it, with miraculous results, into humans with diabetes. Because
> insulin was extracted from the ground-up pancreases of cows and pigs, improving
> the purity of insulin (measured in impure parts per million, or ppm) constituted
> a critical trajectory of performance improvement. Impurities dropped from 50,000
> ppm in 1925 to 10,000 ppm in 1950 to 10 ppm in 1980, primarily as the result of
> persistent investment and effort by the world’s leading insulin manufacturer,
> Eli Lilly and Company.
>
> Despite this improvement, animal insulins, which are slightly different from
> human insulin, caused a fraction of a percent of diabetic patients to build up
> resistance in their immune systems. Thus, in 1978, Eli Lilly contracted with
> Genentech to create genetically altered bacteria that could produce insulin
> proteins that were the structural equivalent of human insulin proteins and 100
> percent pure. The project was technically successful, and in the early 1980s,
> after a nearly $1 billion investment, Lilly introduced its Humulin-brand insulin
> to the market. Priced at a 25 percent premium over insulins of animal
> extraction, because of its human equivalence and its purity, Humulin was the
> first commercial-scale product for human consumption to emerge from the
> biotechnology industry. The market’s response to this technological miracle,
> however, was tepid. Lilly found it very difficult to sustain a premium price
> over animal insulin, and the growth in the sales volume of Humulin was
> disappointingly slow. “In retrospect,” noted a Lilly researcher, “the market was
> not terribly dissatisfied with pork insulin. In fact, it was pretty happy with
> it.”
>
> Lilly had spent enormous capital and organizational energy overshooting the
> market’s demand for product purity. Once again, this was a differentiated
> product to which the market did not accord a price premium because the
> performance it provided exceeded what the market demanded.
>
> Meanwhile, Novo, a much smaller Danish insulin maker, was busy developing a line
> of insulin pens, a more convenient way for taking insulin. Conventionally,
> people with diabetes carried a separate syringe, inserted its needle into one
> glass insulin vial, pulled its plunger out to draw slightly more than the
> desired amount of insulin into the syringe, and held up the needle and flicked
> the syringe several times to dislodge any air bubbles that clung to the cylinder
> walls. They generally then had to repeat this process with a second, slower
> acting type of insulin. Only after squeezing the plunger slightly to force any
> remaining bubbles—and, inevitably, some insulin—out of the syringe could they
> inject themselves with the insulin. This process typically took one to two
> minutes. Novo’s pen, in contrast, held a cartridge containing a couple of weeks’
> supply of insulin, usually mixtures of both the fast-acting and the gradually
> released types. People using the Novo pen simply had to turn a small dial to the
> amount of insulin they needed to inject, poke the pen’s needle under the skin,
> and press a button. The procedure took less than ten seconds. In contrast to
> Lilly’s struggle to command a premium price for Humulin, Novo’s convenient pens
> easily sustained a 30 percent price premium per unit of insulin. Through the
> 1980s, propelled largely by the success of its line of pens and pre-mixed
> cartridges, Novo increased its share of the worldwide insulin market
> substantially—and profitably. Lilly’s and Novo’s experiences offer further proof
> that a product whose performance exceeds market demands suffers commodity-like

## The Unaccountability Machine: Why Big Systems Make Terrible Decisions - and How The World Lost its Mind

**&mdash; by Dan Davies** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197716282-the-unaccountability-machine)〉

I both liked and hated this book - I learned a few interesting things from it:
e.g. it was my first encounter with [Project Cybersyn][] - a failed Chilean
attempt to create an infrastructure for computer assisted planned economy.

The book also introduces the concept of an _accountability sink_ which deeply
resonates with me:

> It is important to be clear, at this stage, exactly what an
> accountability sink is, and how they are constructed. It's not
> just the way in which the hourly paid worker has been set up to
> act as a human shield. In order to make the sink effective, you
> need a combination of things: that person, plus a policy that
> there’s no way to appeal the decision by communicating with a
> higher level of management. (Even if you somehow managed to
> get the CEO’s phone number, you would come up against the
> fact that the policy was in place precisely to protect them from
> making that decision personally.)
>
> So the crucial thing at work here seems to be the delegation of
> the decision to a rule book, removing the human from
> the process and thereby severing the connection that’s needed
> in order for the concept of accountability to make sense. You
> could even coin a sort of law of management here:
>
> > The fundamental law of accountability: the extent to
> > which you are able to change a decision is precisely the
> > extent to which you can be accountable for it, and vice
> > versa.
>
> The construction of accountability sinks has damaging
> implications for the flow of information. For an accountability
> sink to function, it has to break a link; it has to prevent the
> feedback of the person affected by the decision from affecting the
> operation of the system. The decision has to be fully
> determined by the policy, which means that it cannot be altered
> by any information that wasn’t anticipated. If somebody can
> override the accountability sink and overrule a policy that is in
> danger of generating a ridiculous or disgusting outcome, then
> that person is potentially accountable for the outcome.

I agree with Davies that our society and especially large corporations
spend inordinate amount of time constructing these _accountability sinks_
allowing highly paid people in charge (politicians and CEOs) to hide from
the consequences of their actions, which are mostly experienced by
those living on lower levels of the hierarchy.

The book culminates with blaming [Friedman doctrine][] for everything that
is wrong with our society today. I don't really disagree with this - but I
feel that the book spent too many pages to make its point. <sidenote>Despite
being wordy and in many ways redundant this book did cement my decision to
withdraw from people management and focus on the technical leadership
instead.</sidenote>

## The Man Who Broke Capitalism: How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America―and How to Undo His Legacy

**&mdash; by David Gelles** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366216-the-man-who-broke-capitalism)〉

With this book I continued my journey into the heart of _everything that is
wrong with corporate America_. General Electric (GE) is a fascinating
company with a track record of originating or contributing to major innovations
in the first half of 20th century. In the second half of the century the company
ballooned to a juggernaut which quarter after quarter would beat analysts
expectations - driving its share price to incredible heights. Then the music
stopped and GE came crashing down. <sidenote>Somewhere on the shelf we also have <b>Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric</b> 〈<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50086786-lights-out">goodreads</a>〉 which documents collapse of GE under Jeff Immelt who took over from Welch - but I have not read it yet.</sidenote>

Turns out that GEs *profitability* was achieved in the ways which could not be
sustained long term: endless acquisitions, layoffs, restructurings, offshoring,
stock buybacks, financialization and creative accounting - making earnings
reports look good and maximizing shareholder value in a way which would make
Milton Friedman proud, while destroying the company from within. Gelles also
tells stories of companies lured into hiring top-managers from GE in the hope
that these managers will help them to drive their earnings up in the same way
that Welch did to GE. Unsurprisingly results were much less rosy than expectations.

Sobering read - especially if you look around and notice that Welchism is alive
and well today, being applied in companies big and small.

> If Welch was going to make GE the most valuable company on earth,
> he knew he would have to do it with GE Capital. From the moment he first
> worked with the finance division in the late 1970s, he understood a simple but
> powerful truth: it was easier to make money by shifting around ones and zeros
> than by manufacturing refrigerators. "Since I had been involved in making
> things all my life, pounding and grinding it out to make nickel, I couldn't
> believe how easy this appeared to be," he recalled of his first exposure to
> the world of investment banking, leveraged buyouts, and loan financing.
> "I was sure the opportunity was enormous. All we had to do was take the
> business from the back of the boat to the front." In a memo to the company's
> chief financial officer, Welch wrote that finance, not manufacturing,
> represented the future of the company. "There is no place that quantum change
> is needed more than in Finance", he wrote. "Finance is not an institution -
> it has to be ... the driving force behind making General Electric
> 'the most competitive enterprise on earth'".

Well, I threw up a bit in my mouth just retyping this from the book.

## Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System

**&mdash; by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5435210-racing-the-beam)〉

I am too young to have experienced Atari firsthand - but I have at least
_heard_ about it. I think it is impossible to not have heard about it if
you are at least somehow involved with computers and games. When I picked this
book up I expected something similar to Fabien Sanglard's fabulous
[Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/)
and [Game Engine Black Book: DOOM](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/) - a
technical walkthrough through Atari capabilities and deep dive into the
technical challenges of programming games for it. Unfortunately this book was
rather _thin_ on that... instead it walks you through different games which were
released for Atari and the impact they had.

## Blood, Sweat, and Pixels

**&mdash; by Jason Schreier** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels)〉

Game development is a famous for unsustainable schedules and people sleeping
under desks to meet deadlines. I wanted to be a game programmer when I was
a high-schooler - but then I discovered programming languages and never looked
back. This book gave me a small opportunity to peak under the covers and see
how games are made. <sidenote>For what it's worth people are also sleeping under desks in the <b>"The Soul of a New Machine"</b> or <b>"Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft"</b>. Things were different back in the day. Lots of passion. Unclaimed horizons. No work-life balance.</sidenote>

I must admit that I have never played a single game of those described in the
book but that did not make the book less enjoyable to read. Don't think I
learned anything though - turns out that game development is hard work and
stress and politics all mixed together just like in any other branch of software
development.

## Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology

**&mdash; by Chris Miller** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war)〉

I got this book because I became interested in learning more about TSMC and
ASML and the current state of semiconductor technology. I think the book does
a good job at giving you a historical overview of how things got the way
they are today. <sidenote>It is especially interesting to read this book keeping
insights from <b>"Understanding Michael Porter"</b> and <b>"The Man Who Broke Capitalism"</b>
in mind.</sidenote>

The highlight of the book for me was the description of the extreme ultraviolet
lithography. The kind of complexity that goes into building one these EUV
lithography machines - and the web of world binding supply chains this creates
- is mind boggling. EUV light is produced by hitting a tiny (30 micron) tin droplets
flying through a vacuum at 300 km/h with a laser pulse (twice) to evaporate
it into plasma. The produced bursts of light are collected using special mirrors
made of hundreds of alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum - each layer
just few nanometers thick. [MindBlown.GIF](https://media1.tenor.com/m/LVeZa0OwoVgAAAAd/shock-shocked.gif)

## Your Competent Child: Toward New Basic Values for the Family

**&mdash; by Jesper Juul** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1192866.Your_Competent_Child)〉

I picked up this book when our son was just born and only this year I have
finally managed to read it. You will be disappointed if you pick it up
expecting a _reference manual_ on how to handle your relationship with a child.
What this book offers instead are insights into why (at least according to
Jesper Juul) people behave the way they behave and what it means in context
of building a relationship with your growing child. Applying these insights
is up to you as a parent.

This book got me to pause and think more than a couple of times... and that is,
if you ask me, a sign of a good book.

> In a loving relationship between two equal adults, both have
> equal responsibility for the quality of the interaction. But adults
> have complete responsibility for the quality of their interaction
> with children. This applies to the interaction between children and
> parents in a family, and between adults and children in nursery

## With Languages in Mind: Musings of a Polyglot

**&mdash; by Kató Lomb** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32470807-with-languages-in-mind)〉

[Kató Lomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat%C3%B3_Lomb) is a famous Hungarian
simultaneous interpreter, who allegedly could interpret in ~10 languages and
claimed to understand a total of 16 languages. I picked up this book because
I wanted to learn more about her approach to learning foreign languages. This
book is not _that_ though: its an random mix of her thoughts on studying
foreign languages and foreign languages themselves. Truly a book of _musings_
like the title honestly admits. Maybe I should have read **Polyglot: How I Learn Languages**
instead - but reviews indicate that its written in a similar haphazard style.

## The Rules of Programming: How to Write Better Code

**&mdash; Chris Zimmerman** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63337392-the-rules-of-programming)〉

I don't think a seasoned software developer will learn anything groundbreaking
from this book - I personally skimmed through pages rather than immersed myself
in them. Though even seasoned software developers might find articulations
from this book helpful - it is always reassuring to see in writing what you
just kinda intuitively _felt_. But I can totally recommend it to more junior
developers. <sidenote> Speaking of great books every developer should read:
<b>A Philosophy of Software Design</b> by John Ousterhout 〈<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design">good&ZeroWidthSpace;reads</a>〉
is my absolute favourite from recent years.</sidenote>

> There’s a real cost to extra complexity. It takes longer to write

## Good Omens

**&mdash; by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12067.Good_Omens)〉

I used to devour Terry Pratchett's books when I was in high-school, but it has
been many years since I've read anything by him. I got The Illustrated Good
Omens as a birthday present from a friend of mine couple of years back and
it was patiently seating on the shelf waiting to be read.

It's a solid but overhyped book - if you ask me. It was fun to read, it made
me smile here and there - it was Pratchett-y in all the right ways, but it
was all it was. It was **nothing but an escape from reality: an intoxicant and a
narcotic** borrowing words from Kato Lomb.

## The Palace of Dreams

**&mdash; by Ismail Kadare** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/797635.The_Palace_of_Dreams)〉

Ismail Kadare died on the 1st of July 2024 - that's when I heard about him for
the first time. When I first read about him I became fascinated by the fact
that he was audacious enough to sneak obviously subversive and critical
**Palace of Dreams** past communist censors by hiding the critic within a
seemingly historical setting - novel itself unfolds in an alternative version
of an Ottoman Empire. Here is what Wikipedia [writes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palace_of_Dreams#Background) about his strategy:

> Kadare camouflaged an excerpt of The Palace of Dreams as a short story and
> published it, alongside Broken April, The Ghost Rider, and The Wedding,
> in his 1980 collection of four novellas, Gjakftohtësia (Cold-bloodedness).
> Due to its seemingly historical nature, the excerpt went unnoticed by the
> censors. The following year, under the same title, Kadare managed to sneak
> the whole novel into the second edition of Emblema e dikurshme
> (Signs of the past); due to the fact that the story had already been
> green-lighted once, it managed to escape the attention of the censors once
> again.

The novel was eventually condemned and banned, but only post factum:
20000 copies were already sold.

I really enjoyed reading the novel, as much as the world _enjoy_ reading a
story unfolding in a bleak totalitarian society ruled by the whims of its
Sovereign, who itself is manipulated by eponymous _Tabir Sarrail_ (
Palace of Dreams) - a shady government body tasked with collection and
interpretation of dreams:

> “The Tabir Sarrail or Palace of Dreams, as it’s called in the language of
> today, is one of our great imperial State’s most important institutions….”
>
> He was silent for a moment, scrutinizing Mark-Alem as if to assess how far
> he was capable of taking in the meaning of his words. Then he went on:
>
> “The world has long recognized the importance of dreams, and the role they
> play in anticipating the fates of countries and of the people who govern them.
> You have certainly heard of the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece, and of
> the famous soothsayers of Rome, Assyria, Persia, Mongolia, and so on.
> Old books tell sometimes of the beneficial effects of the seers’ predictions,
> sometimes of the penalties incurred by those who rejected them or accepted
> them too late. In short, books record all the events that have ever been told
> of in advance, whether or not they were actually affected by the forecast.
> Now this long tradition undoubtedly has its own importance, but it pales into
> insignificance beside the operations of the Tabir Sarrail. Our imperial State
> is the first in the history of the whole world to have institutionalized the
> interpretation of dreams, and so to have brought it to such a high degree of
> perfection.”
>
> Mark-Alem listened in bewilderment. He still hadn’t quite got over the
> previous emotions of the morning, and this matter-of-fact flood of abstruse
> phrases crowned all!
>
> “The task of our Palace of Dreams, which was created directly by the reigning
> Sultan, is to classify and examine not the isolated dreams of certain
> individuals — such as those who in the past were for one reason or another
> granted the privilege, and who in practice enjoyed the monopoly, of
> prediction through interpretation of divine omens — but the _Tabir_ as a
> whole: in other words, all the dreams of all citizens without exception.
> This is a vast enterprise, beside which the oracles of Delphi and the
> predictions of all the hordes of prophets and magicians in the past are
> derisory. The idea behind the Sovereign's creation of the Tabir is that
> Allah looses a forewarning dream on the world as casually as He unleashes
> a flash of lightning or draws a rainbow or suddenly sends a comet close to
> us, drawn from the mysterious depths of the Universe. He dispatches a signal
> to the earth without bothering about where it will land; He is too far away
> to be concerned with such details. It is up to us to find out where the
> dream has come to earth - to flush it out from among millions, billions of
> others, as one might look for a pearl lost in the desert. For the
> interpretation of that dream, fallen like a stray spark into the brain of
> one out of millions of sleepers, may help to save the country or its
> Sovereign from disaster; may help to avert war or plague or to create new
> ideas.”

For Kadare _Tabir Sarrail_ was an allegory of corrupt and oppressive communist
government of Albania. But I myself could not shake a feeling that social
networks _are_ Tabir Sarrail of today - gigantic funnels collecting and
distilling _Tabir_ of the world.

## Akutagawa Ryunosuke in translations by Natalia Feldman

You probably heard about [Rashōmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon)
a famous film by [Akira Kurosava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa),
which presents that same murder story through eyes of four participants (dead
samurai himself, his wife, bandit and a woodcutter). Their accounts are
contradictory - obscured by lies and desire to present best versions of
themselves - and the truth remains hidden as a result. Rashōmon was largely
based on the short story [In a Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Grove)
by [Akutagawa Ryunosuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABnosuke_Akutagawa)

I always liked the presentation device behind Rashōmon - so I decided to read
the source from which it originated. I was not disappointed. I am sure I miss
a lot of context (familiarity with Japanese culture and history) required to
trully appreciate Akutagawa's writing, but nevertheless, I managed to greatly
enjoy this collection of short stories. After all some truths are universal.

> In killing, I use the sword I wear at my side. Am I the only one who kills
> people? You, you don't use your swords. You kill people with your
> power, with your money. Sometimes you kill them on the pretext of working
> for their good. It's true they don't bleed. They are in the best of health,
> but all the same you've killed them. It's hard to say who is a greater
> sinner, you or me.

## Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

**&mdash; by Robert M. Pirsig** 〈[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)〉

> You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely
> different from any other. In a car you're always in a compartment, and
> because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window
> everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all
> moving by you boringly in a frame.
>
> On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're
> in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is
> overwhelming. That concrete whizzing by five inches below your foot is the
> real thing, the same stuff you walk on, it's right there, so blurred you can't
> focus on it, yet you can put your foot down and touch it anytime, and the
> whole thing, the whole experience, is never removed from immediate
> consciousness.

What is this book about? Dunno. You are travelling through the pages
on a journey that feels endless. Occassionally you hit a golden nugget of
a brilliant observation but most of the time you are tired and exhausted.
And when it ends you find yourself on 101 just past Novato approaching
San Francisco from the South. Hmm. Then you read Pirsig's afterword and
you feel like you have been kicked in the stomach. Life is cruel and
strange sometimes.


I think as a _journey_ this book was well worth my time. It did feel
painfully redundant at times, but I found enough I could relate with to
get through the painful places. I will probably return to it some day
when I am older and wiser. Maybe. Not sure yet.
