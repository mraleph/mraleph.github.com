title: 'Reading in 2025'

Following my [post about books I have read in 2024](/blog/2024/12/26/my-year-in-books.html)
I've gotten few questions asking to share my reading list, books which I am
planning to read in the near future. The reality is that I don't really have
a well-defined reading list. Both me and my wife are suffering from severe
case of _tsundoku_, so we have pile of books on our shelves waiting to be
read. <sidenote><em>tsundoku</em> (積ん読) is a practice of buying
books without actually reading them.</sidenote>

Nevertheless, I certainly have some books I am hoping to read in 2025 divided
into several loosely defined categories.

# Science of Life

I have read [**Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4591.Genome)
few years ago and have been on look out for similar books ever since. My back
log currently contains:

* [**The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530386-the-vital-question)
* [**The Gene: An Intimate History**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene)
* [**The Song of the Cell: An Exploration of Medicine and the New Human**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321392-the-song-of-the-cell)
* [**I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213168-i-contain-multitudes)
* [**How Life Works: A User’s Guide to the New Biology**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123012858-how-life-works) - most recent addition based of Bryan Cantrill's recommendation.

I have tried to read **The Vital Question** before but at some point it became
too dense for my state of mind then and I gave up. I am looking to trying again,
maybe in a different order (e.g. read **How Life Works** first).

# Classics of fiction

## Dostoevsky

I hope to finish [**The Brothers Karamazov** (**Братья Карамазовы**)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov)
this year. Dostoevsky's [**Crime and Punishment** (**Преступление и наказание**)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment)
is part of the highschool literature curriculum - but I must admit I was really
put off by Dostoevsky's _writing_ when I was a teenager. There was something
unpleasant in the way he was building sentences and stringing words together
that made it hard for me to concentrate on his words. Now, as I look back,
and pick up his writing again it hits me very differently. I don't seem to have
any problem with his writing anymore - and I can now actually appreciate what
he writes about. The characters he paints, their thoughts and actions are
something I can finally relate to from the height of my personal experience.
Maybe it is just stupid to ask high-schoolers to read and appreciate Dostoevsky
when they have not lived enough _yet_.

My father is a huge fan of Dostoevsky's writings - he has read most of his
works so many times that the books are literally falling apart. When I was
younger that was one of disagreements between us - whether or not Dostoevsky's
is worth reading. I don't think I will ever see his writing in the same way
my father sees it - but my perception is definitely shifted away from _"Meh,
this is just boooring"_.

## Genji Monogatari

[The Tale of Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji) is a
classic work of Japanese literature dating to 12th century. The first time
I heard about it was when I was in my early teens... Back then I used to read
or better said _swallow_ books by [Brothers Strugatsky (Братья Стругацкие)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_and_Boris_Strugatsky) and
their last hard science fiction novel [**Space Apprentice** (**Стажёры**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Apprentice)
mentions **Genji Monogotari**: <sidenote>Never heard about Strugatsky? Check them out then. My personal favorite is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27219742-the-doomed-city">The Doomed City (Град обречённый)</a>. Other notable works include: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1255122.The_Ugly_Swans">The Ugly Swans (Гадкие лебеди)</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331256.Roadside_Picnic">Roadside Picnic (Пикник на обочине)</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759517.Hard_to_Be_a_God">Hard to Be a God (Трудно быть богом)</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759514.Beetle_in_the_Anthill">Beetle in the Anthill (Жук в муравейнике)</a>. Finally there is hilarious <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18215601-monday-starts-on-saturday">Monday Starts on Saturday (Понедельник начинается в Субботу)</a> - which I think can hold its own against the humour of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams.</sidenote>

That's how I heard of and became interested in **The Tale of Genji**. Last year
(probably more than 20-25 years since I have heard about it for the first time)
I have finally acquired a beautiful illustrated translation with a commentary
and I am hoping to read it this year.

# Stories of people, companies and projects

I have just finished [**747: Creating the World's First Jumbo Jet and Other Adventures from a Life in Aviation**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1267151.747)
by Joe Sutter, the "father of the 747" himself. Sutter joined Boeing at the age
of 25 (in 1946) and worked there as am employee for 40 years until mandatory
retirement at 65. He led 747 design as a chief engineer and it was certainly
interesting to read his account of the events.

I am currently reading [**Showstopper! the Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7049142-showstopper-the-breakneck-race-to-create-windows-nt-and-the-next-genera). I had started on this book some time ago but then put it away for some reason. Going to finish it
now.

Three more books I am hoping to read in this category are:

* [**Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603985.Who_Says_Elephants_Can_t_Dance_Inside_IBM_s_Historic_Turnaround) another book I have started some time ago but did not finish. Planning to return to it, but read it through the prism of **The Man Who Broke Capitalism** and **Understanding Michael Porter**, I've read last year.
* [**Becoming Trader Joe: How I Did Business My Way and Still Beat the Big Guys**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55918690-becoming-trader-joe).
* [**The Bond King: How One Man Made a Market, Built an Empire, and Lost it All**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56268989-the-bond-king)

# Software Engineering

I would like to read [**Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57345270-modern-software-engineering)
and see a) if it is any good and b) if I could myself learn something
interesting. If it is any good I would start recommending it to
junior engineers on the team, similar to how I do it with [**A Philosophy of Software Design**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design).

I also picked up a copy of [**The Art of Writing Efficient Programs: An advanced programmer's guide to efficient hardware utilization and compiler optimizations using C++ examples**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59095357-the-art-of-writing-efficient-programs)
for similar reasons. It has been highly recommended by people I respect and
it does seem like a good introduction to the topic. <sidenote>I've read a few
pages and unfortunately stumbled into minor inaccuracy already. The book
claims that <em>"Google CPU Profiler also uses hardware performance
counters"</em> which is not correct. Hmm.</sidenote>

# Game Development History

I am looking forward to reading [**Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195367901-building-simcity).
I was not a big SimCity player back in the day, but I am certainly more interested
in learning how SimCity works under the cover than in playing it.

# Miscellaneous

My wife recommended me [**How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112974860-how-to-know-a-person),
which she in turn picked up based on [Bill Gates' recommendation](https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Know-a-Person).

I also want to read [**Thinking In Systems: A Primer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) which
I picked up last year based on someone's recommendation on Twitter.
